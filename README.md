A python client for browsing and analyzing SHARE data (https://osf.io/share), gathered with scrAPI (https://github.com/fabianvf/scrapi). It builds heavily (almost completely) on the [elasticsearch-dsl](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-dsl-py) package for handling Elasticsearch querying and aggregations, and contains some additional utilities to help with graphing and analyzing the data.
